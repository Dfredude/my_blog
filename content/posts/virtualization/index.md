# Virtualization

Nowadays everybody’s talking about (and using) containers for software integration and running
apps on these isolated light-weight environments that turn out to be super convenient. Before even
understanding what all this really is, it’s better to go back a bit to understanding what a virtual
machine is, and even further, what virtualization is.

## What is virtualization

When somebody turns on a computer, this neat graphical interface shows up, with icons and
buttons you can click on. This is the Operating System, and the popular OS distributions are
Windows and MacOS.

Knowing what an OS is, it’s time to understand that virtualization is the process of running an
operating system on top of a virtualization layer. Instead of a traditional OS where it interfaces with
the physical components of a computer (Memory, CPU).

Figure 1 shows the difference between a traditional architecture and a virtual architecture or
virtual machine.
