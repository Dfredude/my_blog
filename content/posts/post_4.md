## 3 stages of productivity

Anything you will ever want to achieve boils down in 3 simple steps:

1. **Visualize** what you want to achieve.
2. **Think** a plan on how to achieve it.
3. **Do** it and make it happen.

## Bonus 

Almost everybody visualize what they want, think about how to get it and do certain actions to get to it. However **working hard** is hard but **knowing what to work hard on** is even harder.

- Working hard.
- Knowing what to work hard on.
