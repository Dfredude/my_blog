# 1. You must feel compelled to do it - If you need inspiring words, don't do it

- What Elon is trying to say, is that we should be already motivated by the tasks we are going to do - In this case starting and managing a company.

> In other words find things that inspire, or make them inspiring.

# 2. Focus on improving product/service rather than spending time on BA/Finances

- If a company spends more time on improving its products and/or services, its finances and business administration will easily come together.

# 3. Work as hard as possible 

- The reasoning is simple math, the more you put in, the more you get out. For example:

- • The more you put in the gym the more shredded you'll get.
- • The more you put in studying car mechanics, the more car repairs you'll be able to do.

> If you follow tip #1 this one should come down easily. 

# 4. Surround yourself with persons that support/compliment you

> It's important to have an environment that boosts your way towards acomplishing your goal. 

- The people you suround yourself with is the most important aspect, since they are able to shift your mentality towards negativity and mediocrity or positivity and success.

# 5. Give liberty to your people and to yourself

- Allow mistakes to happen and let people become leaders

# Honorable mention - Provide the knowledge necessary for someone to do your given task at a desired level

> When leading others, you need to make sure they have the context to do their tasks efficiently.
