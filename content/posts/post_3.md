# Is choosing a programming language important?

It is, only if you need to develop software right away, because knowing what language to use to build, e.g. a videogame is very important, you are not gonna build a videogame with HTML.

If you are unsure which one to go for, and just looking for something for to kick off your learning experience then my recommendation of the best 3 is as follows:

1. Python 
2. C
3. C++
