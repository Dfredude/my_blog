Everything in the universe is related to its complement. For example, a mobile application is related to electronics. You could easily deduce it since all software needs hardware on which it can run.

By "Complement" I mean anything other than the first subject. Therefore, we can say that a mobile application is related to something absolutely unimaginable like the sun. Even if it is for a single property. In case of the sun and the cell phone, they both use electromagnetic waves for different purposes.

Intuitively speaking it's a self-proven theory.
