      <description>Everything in the universe is related to its complement. For example, a mobile application is related to electronics. You could easily deduce it since all software needs hardware on which it can run.
By &amp;ldquo;Complement&amp;rdquo; I mean anything other than the first subject. Therefore, we can say that a mobile application is related to something absolutely unimaginable like the sun.

Therefore we need to be imaginative by all these pieces of hardware and software that enable the entire internet.</description>
